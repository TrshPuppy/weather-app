# Weather App

## Watch my [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfd2jD7HYdw) about my process and lessons learned!

### This is my Weather App based on requirements from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app)

The goal of this app was to learn and practice asynchronous code and using an API.

### NOTE:
This project has a lot of flaws for various reasons, the first of which being that in the middle of coding this, I started another [project](github.com/TrshPuppy/trsh-bot). 
This other [project](github.com/TrshPuppy/trsh-bot) taught me a lot more about APIs, asynchronous code and more! Please check it out.

#### Weather App Strengths:
- The JS part of this project is a good example of how my coding has improved regarding OOP principles.
- Using the fetch API was relatively easy and seamless.
- I secure my API key by saving it as a variable in a module which has been ignored (and not pushed to github).

#### Weaknesses:
- Styling: styling is poor because I shifted gears partway through
- The project has generally been left in the dust.
